# Sound Reactive NeoPixel FeatherWing 

The `cp-spakerstand-lights` project is written in CircuitPython and     uses the [NeoPixel FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3124), rp2040 Feather, and a digital microphone breakout board. Together, they create a sound reactive spectrogram displayed on the NeoPixel FeatherWing.

I can't take credit for probably 90% of the code, it was adapted from these two projects, especially the second one:

* Adapted from the [FFT Example: Waterfall Spectrum Analyzer](https://learn.adafruit.com/ulab-crunch-numbers-fast-with-circuitpython/overview ) by Jeff Epler

* Also adapted from [Mini LED Matrix Audio Visualizer](https://learn.adafruit.com/mini-led-matrix-audio-visualizer/code-the-mini-led-matrix-audio-visualizer) by Liz Clark

I will be installing the NeoPixel FeatherWing in AudioEngine P4 speaker stands which I will be 3D printing (and will add the CAD and STL files here when complete).
